Good progress team. It seems like you are having some trouble with recommender system. 
Don't forget that your project is a difficult one and it pays off to use a modular approach, getting something easier to work correctly first, before building on top of it. For example, you are considering online training as user provides input.
However, if you already have a dataset and the user preference in terms of hiking difficulty etc. , I don't see why you shouldn't be able to have a pretrained model and just recommend based on user profile. 
This needs an embedding that searches for matching features based on user profile and hikes. 
One more thing, distance from user seems like an important feature to consider when recommending hikes. For example, I don't want to travel 100KM just for a hike!
Please use my comments only as advice, as your team makes the final decisions for your project. 
P.S don't forget to try things out. You will never know what works and what doesn't unless you actually try it (hinting to different recommender models you are considering!)
